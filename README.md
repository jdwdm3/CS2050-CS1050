#CS2050-CS1050

##Jeremy Warden Syllabus/Rules

1. I believe in a relaxed learning enviorment, and my Labs will be just that: Learning. This is not a two a half hour test. HOWEVER, with that being said, if you fail to show up prepared (Completed and UNDESTANDING of PreLab) I will refuse to assist. There are 30 of you and one of me, I will be assisting students who put in the effort outside of class, and not those who desperately attempt to figure out a weeks worth of information within a two and a half hour window.

2. ALL GRADE CHANGES AND REQUEST WILL NOT ENTERTAINED AFTER 14 CALANDER DAYS OF THAT ASSIGNMENT/LABS COMPLETION. It is entirely on you to ensure that your grades are accurate.  Mistakes happen, I have occasionally missed a students submission, or entered the wrong grade.  Even if it is my mistakte, you need to be an advicate for youself and take care of any mistake within that two week window.

3. I WILL CATCH YOU CHEATING.  I personally have control over anything and everything with this lab.  I can promise you, I will not let you get away with cheating.  I have seen way to many students my age advance through courses that don't know anything, and really hurt group members in later courses because they don't have the skill or knowlege to contribute.  If I catch you it's an automatic ZERO for everyone involved. Period.


  To be continued (If necassary I will add more policies as the semester goes on and I feel the need to add anything)
